Make sure you have python installed (`python --version` or `python3 --version`) and pip (`pip --version` or `pip3 --version`).

Get all dependencies by running the GetDependencies scripts or by running `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` in the repo root folder.

Lastly fill in your credentials at the bottom of the script in the main function
```python
...
if __name__ == "__main__":
    EMAIL = ""
    PASSWORD = ""
...
```
