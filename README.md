Make sure you have python installed (`python --version` or `python3 --version`) and pip (`pip --version` or `pip3 --version`).

Fill in your credentials at the bottom of the script in the main function
```python
...
if __name__ == "__main__":
    EMAIL = ""
    PASSWORD = ""
...
```

And lastly run the right script by either just clicking on one or running them throught the console (`./startWindows.bat`)
